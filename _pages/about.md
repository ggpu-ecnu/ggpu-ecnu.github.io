Geguang Pu is a full professor of software engineering at East China Normal University. His research interests span the areas of software modeling, automated testing, model checking and reliable AI. A common thread in Geguang's research is improving software reliability and trustworthiness by developing FM-based tools. Geguang joined East China Normal University in 2005 as an assistant professor and prior to that, he studied for Ph. D in PKU and got the bachelor in WHU.

He serves on the Editorial Board for the Software Engineering Nexus as Co-Editor-in-Chief with Sun Jun. The main mission of SENE is to find excellent researchers who did impactful work in academia or industry, but not only to find the good papers themselves.

He took the position of CEO in Shanghai Trusted Industrial Control Platform Co., Ltd for the technique transfer, where he led a strong engineering team to develop the tool chains for software modeling, testing and verification, and these tools are used by more than 200 institutes/companies for structuring reliable software systems. He knew that when a great idea turned into a product needed by industry, there was still a long and difficult road ahead.

His broad interests include philosophizing about the future society to be shaped by AI, and the new education paradigm to be generated correspondingly. His Chinese book " The Natural Principles for the Competency Building" will be published in 2027.
