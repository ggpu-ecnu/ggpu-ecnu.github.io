## Student Recruitment

I am always looking for self-motivated Ph.D. and Master students to join my group.

*   **Requirements (Ph.D./Master):** 1-2 Ph.D. students and 2-3 Master students per year.
*   **For candidates:** I am looking for students who are upright, diligent, love coding, enjoy thinking, and have the ability to work under pressure.

## Research Principles

1.  **Problem and tool-driven research:** Solve a problem, develop a tool, and help the industry.
2.  **Solve real problems:** Solve open problems or real problems that exist in the industry.
3.  **From software to system:** Not only write code, but also develop software systems, either open source or commercial.
