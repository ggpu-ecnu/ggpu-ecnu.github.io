Course: The Problem-Driven Algorithm Design

This course flips the traditional algorithm curriculum. Instead of starting with classic algorithms, we begin with real-world, complex problems from areas like data science, networks, and AI systems. Students will learn to dissect ambiguous challenges, formulate precise models, and then design, analyze, and tailor algorithmic solutions. This course is for first-year students.
